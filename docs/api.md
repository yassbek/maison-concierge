# API Rules

## Logging

`apps/api/src/logging`. `new Logger(Thing.name)` picks up `ContextLogger`. **Never
`console.log`.** Format follows `NODE_ENV` and is not configurable.

- **One object, not extra arguments** — `logger.log({ message: "Saved", userId })`;
  Nest prints a line per argument.
- **Errors pass the stack second** — `logger.error({ message }, err.stack)`. Passing
  the error object drops the trace.
- **Never log headers, query strings, or bodies** — cookies and personal data.
- **`LoggingModule` stays first in `AppModule`'s imports**, and Better Auth routes log
  via its own `middleware` option — it mounts before `MiddlewareConsumer`, so
  `/api/auth/*` never reaches ours.
- `requestId` from `RequestLoggerMiddleware` via `AsyncLocalStorage`;
  `UserContextInterceptor` adds `userId`. Prisma statements are opt-in
  (`PRISMA_LOG_QUERIES`).

## Intelligence never lives in the API

The API serves HTTP, auth, tRPC and the mailbox sync. It does **not** research, enrich,
score, summarise, match identities or decide anything about a person or company — not
as a fallback, not behind a flag. That is the eve agent in `apps/agent`, which owns
the vendor clients, the confidence model and the writes.

Nest's half is to report *that something happened*: `AgentTriggerService` writes an
`AgentTask` row. A row, not an HTTP call — the agent already leases from that table,
so the row survives the agent being down.

About to add a vendor client to `apps/api`? You want `apps/agent/agent/lib`. One
documented exception, for timing: the exchange-rate fetcher, below.

## One organization, and it is not a tenancy boundary

Single tenant. No org header, no org interceptor, no org-scoped cache keys, **no
`organizationId` on any CRM record.**

A **singleton workspace** exists — Better Auth's `organization` plugin, one row with
id `WORKSPACE_ID` (the literal `workspace`, in `@crm/db`, re-exported by `@crm/auth`
so the agent needn't depend on it). It answers only: what are we called, who works
here, what do we sell.

- **The id is a constant, never a parameter.** A function taking an `organizationId`
  has turned the plugin into tenancy plumbing.
- **Signing in is the join; no invite flow.** `ensureWorkspaceMembership` runs in
  `databaseHooks.session.create.before` and **degrades, never throws** — a throw fails
  the session create and locks everyone out. The plugin's `invitation` table is unused.
- **First account is owner**, and the hook enrols pre-existing users, oldest first.
- **Permissions come from `@crm/auth`** — `canRenameWorkspace`, `canChangeRole`,
  `canConfigureSso`, `canManageCurrency` — enforced by the service *and* used to
  disable the UI control, so the button and the 403 cannot disagree.
  `WorkspaceService` adds one invariant: **the last owner cannot be demoted**, with
  `FOR UPDATE` on the owner rows before counting.
- **Reads and writes go through tRPC**, not `authClient.organization.*`.
- **Name and website are required at onboarding and cannot be skipped**, in the form
  *and* in `updateWorkspaceInput`, posting the same `workspace.update` as settings.
- **Onboarded state is `onboardedAt` inside the plugin's `metadata` blob**, not a
  column; `isOnboarded`/`markOnboarded` (`@crm/db/workspace`) are the only accessors,
  and `markOnboarded` preserves every other key.
- **The name starts as `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_NAME` (`CRM`), a placeholder not an
  answer.** The header renders `<name> CRM`, so `workspaceLabel` tests the name rather
  than comparing to the default.
- **The website queues the agent's `workspace-profile` task** and goes through
  `normalizeDomain`, rejecting null. Stored canonical, so re-saving uncanonically
  counts as a change and re-queues research.

### Gates in `proxy.ts`

Onboarding, then `/onboarding/research` for the Context key. Asked server-side every
request.

- **`getSessionCookie()` decides signed-in**; pages still resolve the real session via
  `requireMailboxAccess()`.
- **Nothing is cached in a cookie** — both facts revert on a database reset while a
  year-long marker insists the gate passed. Cache in the API if cost ever matters.
- **Both reads run concurrently**, but order decides which is *asked* — the research
  read is never made while onboarding is open.
- **An unreachable API fails open** (`unknown` lets the request through).
- **`/sign-in`, `/grant-access`, `/eve` are ungated.** `/sign-in` is the only path a
  stranger may read; `/` joins it only when `IS_MARKETING` is set.
- **There is no way past the key gate but to answer** — Skip stranded installs, every
  later company sitting `PENDING` with nothing saying so.

### The name is also the URL

Served under the workspace slug (`/comp-ai/companies`). **Cosmetic, not tenancy** —
every query still resolves through `WORKSPACE_ID`.

- **The slug is the plugin's column**, written by `workspaceSlug(name)`
  (`@crm/db/workspace`) on rename and create. **Never derive it on read.**
- `ensureWorkspaceMembership` reconciles it; `RESERVED_SLUGS` prevents collision with
  a real route (a collision gets `-crm`).
- **The proxy is the only thing that puts the slug on.** Missing or stale slugs are
  redirected with the query string intact, not 404'd; `[slug]/layout.tsx` is the
  backstop.
- `appPath` in `proxy.ts` is the one place `/` resolves for a signed-in rep, which
  keeps every `callbackURL` correct without knowing about slugs.
- **Renaming moves the URL**, so `workspace-form.tsx` replaces the location onto the
  slug `workspace.update` returns.

## SSO is a row, not a deployment

An `ssoProvider` row via Better Auth's `sso` plugin, on Settings → SSO, because a
self-hoster's admin cannot redeploy.

- **OpenID Connect only** — issuer, client id, secret; endpoints from discovery. No
  SAML UI: it needs an X.509 cert and SP signing key we have nowhere to keep.
- `SsoService` passes `WORKSPACE_ID`, never an input.
- **Management is tRPC (`sso.*`); signing in is `authClient.signIn.sso()`.**
- **`sso.signInOptions` is the one public procedure in the app.** Every other `sso.*`
  takes `AuthMiddleware` at the *method*, which is what leaves it open. A client
  secret is never read back out.
- **It is the API's answer, not the app's** — the API serves `/api/auth/*`.
- **An install with no Google, no Microsoft and no provider says so**, naming the
  variables; a read that *fails* falls back to offering Google.
- **A provider hides the social buttons, it does not disable them** —
  `/sign-in?method=google` and `?method=microsoft` still work, so a mistyped issuer
  cannot lock an admin out.
- **Signing in with an IdP does not cost you Gmail.** `needsMailboxGrant` (`@crm/auth`)
  walls only an account whose sign-in rows are *all* mailbox providers — Google,
  Microsoft, or both — and none of them granted. `mailboxGrantsNeeded` returns which,
  so `/grant-access` offers the button they can actually use.
- `ALLOWED_SIGN_IN` still decides who gets an account, in
  `databaseHooks.user.create.before`, for SSO sign-ups too.
- `organizationProvisioning: { disabled: true }` — `ensureWorkspaceMembership` already
  does the join.

## tRPC is the data surface; REST is auth and health only

- **One router per module**, `*.router.ts` (the codegen glob), with
  `@Router({ alias })` and `@UseMiddlewares(AuthMiddleware)`. **No `AuthMiddleware`
  means public — there is no other guard.**
- **Routers are thin**: zod in, service call out; Prisma lives in `*.service.ts`.
- Services throw Nest's `HttpException` family; `DomainErrorMiddleware` maps them.
- **Filter, sort and paginate in Prisma.** List procedures take `listInput` and return
  `{ rows, total, facetCounts }`. Never filter a whole table in the browser; never
  interpolate `sort` into a field name — use `resolveOrderBy`.
- **`src/generated/server.ts` is generated *and committed*, and `build` must never
  regenerate it** — the generator needs GLIBC 2.39, newer than Vercel's build image.
  Only `check-types` and `dev` run it. If the app cannot see a new procedure, it has
  not run.

## The OpenAPI document is built at runtime, not committed

`GET /openapi.json` serves one document: Nest's own controllers plus a REST bridge
under `/rest` generated from every tRPC procedure. Swagger UI renders it at `/`.
`createApp` builds both halves and merges them, so nothing is generated at build
time and no file is checked in — the document is whatever the routers are.

`SwaggerModule.setup` runs **before** `app.init()`, because it registers its Express
routes synchronously and Nest's own routing would otherwise shadow them. The factory
form defers building the document to the first request, which is what lets it read
the tRPC router that only exists after init.

Two rules follow for the serverless build:

- `@nestjs/swagger` stays in `EXTERNALS` in `apps/api/scripts/build-func.mjs`, because
  `swagger-ui-dist` resolves its assets from disk at runtime and cannot be bundled.
- Anything external must be **vendored**, and vendoring follows non-optional
  `peerDependencies`, not only `dependencies`. Nest packages declare their runtime
  needs as peers, so following `dependencies` alone ships a function that throws
  `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on the first request. Adding a name to `EXTERNALS` without
  checking it lands in `.vercel/output` breaks production, and the build stays green.

## Two mail providers, one pipeline

`apps/api/src/mailbox` is everything neither Google nor Microsoft owns:
`MailboxApiClient` (bearer GET, and the one place a status code becomes an outcome),
`SyncStateService` (the `MailboxSync` row), `MailboxTokenService`,
`MailboxMatchService`, `participants.ts`, `message-text.ts`, and
`ThreadWriterService`.

- **`ThreadWriterService.store` is the only writer of `EmailThread`, `EmailMessage`
  and the `EMAIL` activity.** Gmail and Outlook each parse their own wire format down
  to one `IncomingMessage` and hand it over; matching, threading, counting and
  stamping happen once. A second copy of that is how a rule like *reply before you
  create a company* comes to be true in one inbox and not the other.
- **A thread is keyed by RFC message id, not by the provider's thread id.** Root comes
  from `References` → `In-Reply-To` → own `Message-ID`, so a rep on Gmail and a rep on
  Outlook land on the same `EmailThread` for the same conversation. Graph only returns
  `internetMessageHeaders` when `$select`ed and not for every message, so Outlook falls
  back to `outlook-conversation:<conversationId>` — threading that still holds inside
  Outlook, just not across to Gmail.
- **`MailboxSync.source` is the discriminator** — `calendar`, `gmail`, `outlook`. Each
  provider's module only ever sees its own, and `sync/mailbox-sync.service.ts` is the
  one place that dispatches. One cron, one budget:
  `POST /internal/sync/mailboxes` (`/google` is kept as an alias so an existing
  deployment's cron keeps working).
- **Gmail is forward-only from a `historyId`, Outlook from a timestamp.** Graph has no
  mailbox-wide delta, so the Outlook cursor is the last `receivedDateTime` seen,
  re-read with a one-second overlap; `rfcMessageId` is unique, so the overlap costs a
  duplicate fetch and never a duplicate row.
- **Microsoft has no token-revocation endpoint.** `revoke` clears the columns and the
  UI says the consent itself is removed in the user's Microsoft account. Google's still
  posts to `oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke` and refuses to clear if that fails.

## Not every address on a thread is a person

`externalParticipants` (`mailbox/participants.ts`) is the one gate, discarding **us**
(allow-list domains, `User` table), **rep decisions** (`SuppressedContact`,
`SuppressedDomain`), and **addresses no human reads**.

- **`isMachineDomain` (`companies/domain.ts`) sits beside `FREE_EMAIL_DOMAINS`**;
  `domainFromEmail` returns null for both, and `companyForEmail` is the only path from
  address to company — so a caller ignorant of the rule still cannot create one.
  `.calendar.google.com` covers shared calendars, rooms and ICS feeds.
- **Matches the host, never a substring** — `calendar.acme.com` is a real company.
- **`isMachineAddress` also catches opaque local parts** (24 hex chars, UUIDs),
  deliberately narrow: a false positive is a real customer never filed.
- **It leaves no row** — a rep may still type these into quick-add; only the *inbox*
  is barred from deciding. `syncAttendees` filters the same addresses beside
  `attendee.resource`.
- **`isAutomatedAddress` is a separate list about the local part** (`sales@`,
  `noreply@`), which is why `support@acme.com` never becomes a lead.

## People on a deal

`DealContact` is the join, and `deals.attachContact` / `detachContact` /
`setContactRole` are the only ways to write it. `deals.contactOptions` is what the
picker reads.

- **A contact on a deal works at that deal's company**, enforced in the service and
  not merely by the picker — the same rule as `companies.setPrimaryContact`.
- **Attaching is an upsert and re-attaching keeps the role already there**, so a
  double click cannot blank what somebody typed.
- **Detaching removes the row, never the contact.** They stay in the CRM, on the
  company, with their history.
- **`role` is blanked to null, never stored as `""`** — `blankToNull`, as everywhere
  else.

## Deleting a record is archive first, purge later

`contacts.archive`, `companies.archive`, `deals.archive` set `archivedAt`. Nothing
else changes — no suppression, no cascade cleanup, no stamp recompute — because the
row is still there, just filtered out of every list.

- **`archivedFilter(input.archived)` is in every `buildWhere` and every `facetCounts`
  where.** A list call defaults to `archived: false`; the Archived view is the same
  procedure with `archived: true`. There is no third "everything" mode — mixing
  active and archived rows in one table is exactly what this feature removes.
- **`archive`/`restore` are a bare `update({ archivedAt })`, nothing more.** They do
  not touch `AgentTask`, `SuppressedContact`, or `lastActivityAt` — the record is
  unchanged, only hidden.
- **`purge` is the old `delete`.** Same transaction, same suppression, same
  `AgentTask`/`AgentEvent` cleanup, same `ActivityStampService.recomputeAfterDelete`.
  Read the rest of this section as `purge`'s contract, not `archive`'s.
- **A rep can `purge` straight from the Archived view — retention is a ceiling, not a
  wait.** `bulkPurge`/the per-record "Delete forever" action call it directly, no
  different from the cron.

**Pruning**: `ArchiveRetentionController` (`internal/archive/prune`, `CRON_SECRET`-gated,
`apps/api/vercel.json`) reads `AppSetting.archiveRetentionDays`
(`readArchiveRetentionDays`, `@crm/db/settings`, default 180) and calls each service's
`purgeExpired(before)` — `findMany({ archivedAt: { lte: before } })` capped at
`ARCHIVE.prune.maxBatch` (`archive/archive-config.ts`), then `purge` per row through
the ordinary `runBulk`. Settings → General has the day count
(`settings.archiveRetention` / `setArchiveRetention`).

Below is `purge`'s contract — everything that used to be `delete`'s:

- **A purged contact is suppressed by address**, or the sync recreates them from the
  next thread. `ContactsService.purge` writes `SuppressedContact`, and
  `externalParticipants` drops it like a `SuppressedDomain` — one filter covering
  contact creation, company auto-creation and attribution.
- **Keyed lower case.** `normalizeEmail` (`crm/values.ts`) is the one canonicaliser,
  on `contacts.create`, `.update` and the suppression; conflict checks and `allowAgain`
  match case-insensitively.
- **The address comes from the delete itself**
  (`tx.contact.delete({ select: { email: true } })`), not a read before it — and the
  404 is that statement's own `P2025` through `translate`.
- **Adding them back lifts the suppression** via `allowAgain` **inside the write's
  transaction**. Never automatic.
- **Purging a company does not suppress its domain** — its people survive with no
  company, and domain suppression stays the explicit Settings → Connections control.
- **Clear `AgentTask` and `AgentEvent` yourself** — they carry `contactId`/`companyId`
  with no foreign key, so nothing cascades.
- **Recompute `lastActivityAt` on exactly the records the purge reached.**
  `ActivityStampService.targetsOf(where)` collects them *inside* the transaction (the
  evidence is what gets deleted); `recomputeMany` restamps. A company's `where` must
  follow its deals: `{ OR: [{ companyId }, { deal: { companyId } }] }`.
  `recomputeAll()` is for a purge only.
- **Recompute after commit, logging rather than throwing** — the row is already gone,
  and a raised error makes the browser skip invalidation and retry into a 404.

## Money

A deal is sold in one currency and reported in another, and **only `baseAmount` may
ever be summed**. The rules — `baseCurrency`, `countedWhere`/`pendingWhere`, frozen
rates, the supported currencies, the keyless feed, and why the fetcher is the one
documented exception to *no intelligence in the API* — are in **`docs/currency.md`**.
Read it before touching any amount, total, chart or rate.

## Freshness: invalidate the query, don't disable the cache

- **Invalidate in `onSuccess` through `useCrmCache()`** (`lib/trpc/cache.ts`), never by
  listing keys at the call site. Say what changed — `cache.deal(id)`,
  `cache.company(id)`, `cache.contact(id)`, `cache.activity()`. **A new mutation adds a
  call there, not a new list of keys.**
- **A deletion is `cache.removed(ref)`** — one wide fan-out, and the only place
  `refetchType: "none"` is right: the deleted record's `byId` query is still mounted
  while the sheet animates shut, so refetching reads a 404 into the closing sheet,
  while leaving it alone serves 30s of a dead record from cache.
- **`{ settle: "record" }`** for inline editors, so the field's spinner clears without
  waiting for the table.
- **Infinite queries need `pathKey()`, not `queryKey()`** — the latter stamps
  `{ type: "query" }` and silently cannot match `{ type: "infinite" }`.
  `activities.timeline` is read both ways.
- **`cache-manager` is per-value and opt-in**, not an interceptor;
  `AuthService.getProfile` is the model.
- **Background writes need polling, not invalidation** — `refetchInterval` while
  `PENDING`/`RUNNING`, via `isEnriching()` and `ENRICHMENT_POLL_MS`. **Lists poll too,
  not just the sheet.**
